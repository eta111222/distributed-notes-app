# Distributed Microservice â€” Note Application (Python, Flask, Node.js, Javascript, RabbitMQ, MongoDB Atlas, Docker, Nginx) 

A microservices-based architecture that splits the application into independent modules: user service, note service, notification service, and log service, all routed through an API gateway using Nginx.

-Achieved user authentication and note CRUD operations 

-Implemented RabbitMQ for event-driven notifications and logging

-Centralized API routing with Nginx for load balancing and RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.

-Dockerized the entire application, with each microservice running in its own container
